        <p>
          I am a junior Java Back-End developer looking for my first opportunity
          in technology. I am passionate about solving problems through code and
          building well-structured, secure, and easy-to-maintain APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been studying the Java ecosystem intensively, focusing on
          Spring Boot, as well as essential tools such as Docker, Git, and
          MySQL. I like to understand how systems work behind the interfaces,
          and my goal is to contribute to scalable, high-performance, and
          well-architected applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have developed personal projects that simulate real-world scenarios,
          including user authentication, permission control, and database
          integration. I am also delving deeper into automated testing,
          versioning best practices, and Clean Code principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new things, playing video games,
          and exploring tools that increase my productivity as a developer. I am
          motivated to grow professionally and be part of teams that value
          collaboration, quality, and continuous learning.
